TRANSLATING PLAYSMS
--------------------

To create a new tranlation of playsms, you will have copy the translation for english
 to your destination language
For example, to translate from english (en_US) to catalan (ca_ES) you should do the
 following

cp -a plugin/language/en_US plugin/language/ca_ES

You will have to edit the following files:

 - docs/README #this is the readme document with the authors of the translations
 - LC_MESSAGES/message.po #is the file with the translations

Once you have translated the .po file into your language of choice, you have
 to convert the file into .mo (machine object), you can probably do it with
 any translation software, if you want you can do it from the command line
 by doing:

msgfmt messages.po

NOTE: 
The messages.po file will have to be in plugin/language/ca_ES/LC_MESSAGES/


UPDATE THE TRANSLATIONS
-----------------------

From time to time the translation strings have to be updated to reflect the
 new strings added to the code, this process can  in part be automated

NOTE: playsms is using a layered structure for the translations, so for
 each module there is it's own translation

To update the core translations (everything under lib and inc) you have to 
 follow this steps
1.- Go to the document root of your web installation
	cd /var/www/playsms
2.- Update the pot file with the updated strings (from /lib and /inc)
	touch plugin/language/messages.pot #Create the file if it doesn't exist
	find lib/ -iname "*.php" -exec xgettext --from-code=utf-8 -j -o plugin/language/messages.pot {} \;
	find inc/ -iname "*.php" -exec xgettext --from-code=utf-8 -j -o plugin/language/messages.pot {} \;
3.- Merge the updated .pot file with the existant translations (to keep the already translated strings)
	cd /var/www/playsms/plugin/language
	for i in `ls -1 | grep -v '\.'` ; do echo "msgmerge $i/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po messages.pot >$i/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po.new && mv -f $i/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po.new $i/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po" ; done
4.- You can now translate the missing translations with you favourite editor and send them back
     to the developers so they can update the strings for the next version
5.- For any time there are new .po files their correspondant .mo files need to be
     generated, this is a simple way of doing it
	cd /var/www/playsms/plugin/language
	for i in `ls -1 | grep -v '\.'` ; do msgfmt -vv $i/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po -o $i/LC_MESSAGES/messages.mo  ; done

To update the rest of the translations a similar process could be done for the
 folders containing more translations as of today (20/03/12)) the following folders contain
 message files

	./plugin/gateway/_template/
	./plugin/gateway/gammu/

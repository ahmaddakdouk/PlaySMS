playSMS gateway module for clickatell.com
Incoming SMS use gnokii model (spool directory, but dont have tobe gnokii) or callback URL
Outgoing SMS use clickatell.com

Register yourself at Clickatell website, you have to create a new connection (clickatell
 allows different interacion systems), at this moment playsms works with "HTTP/S"
After creating the Connection take note of your username, password, client ID and API ID
 since those items are required to configure the gateway module

Dont forget to point callback setting on Clickatell control panel, otherwise you won't
 be able to track the status of your messages
eg:
since 0.9.5.1 the URL should be:
http://your_playsms_website/index.php?app=call&cat=gateway&plugin=clickatell&access=callback
prior to 0.9.5.1:
http://your_playsms_website/plugin/gateway/clickatell/callback.php
